TicTacToe via Python 3.0 (project #2)

Created a simple tic-tac-toe game using python 3.0. Designed to be run on one computer with 2 players taking part on the same keyboard.

The game allows a user to choose a marker (X or O) and then proceed to choose a position on the "game board" using the numpad positions of 1 to 9. The game takes the players chosen position and then reassigns the position on the board (which is essentailly list) with their selected marker.

This is repeated until the board is full (draw) or if either player 1 or 2 wins. They are then asked to replay the game if they wish.

Simple enough, but very happy with the result. This is a V.1.0 so definetly can clean up the code itself and add in a bit more functionality.
